## What it does
- Diary entries in Markdown
- Portfolio projects in Markdown
- Photos hosted from `/public`

## Why it matters
I wanted a personal site that feels calm and honest — not a template.

## Next improvements
- Better projects with screenshots
- Real “About” copy
- Optional CMS admin login
