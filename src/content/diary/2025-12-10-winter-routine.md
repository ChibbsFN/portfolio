    I started doing one **small thing** every morning:

- Open the curtains as soon as I wake up  
- Make coffee (no phone)  
- Walk 10 minutes outside, even when it’s grey

It sounds silly, but it made the whole day feel easier.

If you want the “work side” of me, check the **Portfolio** page too.
